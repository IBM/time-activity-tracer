# time-activity-tracer
Time-Activity Tracer is a system of devices that can be used for the purpose of automating "time and motion" studies electronically. A typical use case is to record the time spent by patients in a clinic at the various rooms, and the duration of a "contact" (close proximity) of the patient with other patients and health care workers.
